Description: Include classifying site classes based on the stand height growth and establish a nonlinear mixed-effect biomass model under different site classes based on the whole stand model to achieve more accurate carbon sequestration. In particular, a carbon sequestration potentiality calculation method based on the potential mean annual increment is proposed. This package is applicable to both natural and plantation forests. It can quantitatively answer how much of the stand's potential productivity, realized productivity, and room for improvement under a certain site, and can be used in many aspects such as site quality assessment, tree species suitability evaluation, and degraded forest evaluation.
